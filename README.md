# Human-Activity-Recognition
Human Activity Recognition using time-series data collected by sensors from various subjects. 
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model based on data collected from a wearable sensor. 
It represents positions and accelerations over a short time period (1-4 seconds), in 100 Hz granularity.
